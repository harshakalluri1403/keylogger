# Keylogger Application
### Description
This Python-based keylogger application captures keystrokes and logs them in real-time using the pynput library. It displays the logged keystrokes in a graphical interface built with tkinter.

### Features
Records all keystrokes (including special keys).
Displays the captured keys in a real-time log window.
Provides a simple and easy-to-use GUI.
### Requirements
To run this keylogger application, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```
pip install pynput tkinter
```
### How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:
```
python C1.py
```
The keylogger captures keystrokes using pynput's keyboard.Listener.
Keystrokes are processed and displayed in a tkinter text widget.
The log updates every second (1000ms) to show the latest keystrokes.
### Notes
The application displays special keys (like Key.shift, Key.space) along with regular text input.
Be cautious when using or distributing keyloggers, as they may have ethical and legal implications depending on the jurisdiction.
